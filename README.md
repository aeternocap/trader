### Goal
To produce an average >20% per year with a minimum of risk.

### Overall Strategy
Use one of a set of rule-based or mostly-rule-based systems to trade daily charts from, in sync whith market phase.

### Overall Tactics
Develop and maintain multiple rule-based, or mostly-rule-based systems, and deploy each when it is in-phase.
In this way, there will always be 1 chief system running the show, and at least two backups ready to step up, should the market phase change.
Each system should have clear definitions for the following components and a proven track record of Goal-reaching success:
*Entry Method* - how and when does a given symbol signal an entry (up or down) in this system?
*Position Sizing* - how many shares/lots of the symbol should be purchased/sold, so as to achieve risk/goal-reward balance?
*Exit Strategy* - how and when does a trade terminate? What kind of stops are used? When and how are stops moved?

### Bull Market Systems

### Sideways/Unclear Market Systems

### Bear Market Systems
