what system performs best on a given ticker?

code should work like this:
./edwards TICKER DD/MM/YYY SYSTEMNAME
=> best params for SYSTEMNAME are: X, Y, Z.
=> Total Return:  XX%
=> Max Drawdown:  XX%
=> Win %:         XX%
=> Avg Win:       X.XR
=> Avg Loss:      X.XR
=> Expectancy:    X.XR

which could, for example, search for the best params for an SMA crossover system. basically it has to backtest over a dataset repeatedly in order to converge on the best parameters for return.

things I need to build:
- data-getting method
- backtesting system
- system definition method

- "SMA vs price" system
- candle-logic system
